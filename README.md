## 🧱 Database Schema

### 🔑 Users Table
- `UserID`, `Name`, `Email`, `Password`, `Height`, `Weight`, `BMI`, `MedicalHistoryID`

### 🔐 Credentials
- `CredentialID`, `Email`, `PasswordHash`, `Role (admin/patient)`, `UserID`

### 🗓️ Appointments
- `AppointmentID`, `Date`, `Time`, `UserID`, `DieticianID`

### 👩‍⚕️ Dieticians
- `DieticianID`, `Name`, `Specialization`

### 📋 Diet Plans & Meals
- `DietPlanID`, `PlanName`, `Description`, `UserID`, `NutritionalGoal`
- `Meals`: `MealID`, `MealName`, `Calories`, `NutritionalValue`, `Type (Veg/Non-Veg)`
- `DietPlanMeals`: `DietPlanID`, `MealID`

### 🍱 Meal Logs
- `MealLogID`, `Date`, `MealType`, `CalorieIntake`, `UserID`, `MealID`

### 🏃 Exercise Logs
- `ExerciseLogID`, `Date`, `ActivityType`, `Duration`, `CaloriesBurned`, `UserID`

### 🎯 User Goals
- `GoalID`, `UserID`, `DailyCalorieLimit`, `NutritionalGoal`

## 📐 Architecture Overview

- **Frontend**: Built with React + Vite, using hooks and context API for clean state management.
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express to handle RESTful APIs for user management, diet planning, appointments, and logs.
- **Database**: MySQL relational schema with normalized tables, foreign keys, triggers, and stored procedures.

---

## 🔐 Security & Constraints

- Role-based access using `enum('admin', 'patient')`
- All sensitive actions are gated via token/session logic (JWT recommended)
- Referential integrity ensured using foreign key constraints
- Triggers can be used to:
  - Auto-calculate BMI
  - Alert on unhealthy food patterns
  - Prevent appointment conflicts

## 🚀 Installation & Setup

1. **Clone Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/healthcare-dbms.git
   cd healthcare-dbms
   ```

2. **Backend Setup**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   # Set DB credentials in `.env`
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Frontend Setup**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **MySQL Setup**
   - Create the database:
     ```sql
     CREATE DATABASE healthcare_db;
     ```
   - Run schema scripts from `/sql/schema.sql` to set up tables and constraints.

---

## 🧪 Testing & Validation

- Unit tests with `Jest` for backend logic.
- SQL trigger testing via `INSERT` simulations.
- BMI trigger, appointment scheduler, meal tracking tested manually.

---

## 📄 Future Enhancements

- 🌍 Multilingual frontend
- 📱 Mobile version (React Native)
- 📤 Export reports to PDF, CSV, JSON
- 📊 Charts with Chart.js or Recharts
- 🧠 AI-driven meal recommendations
